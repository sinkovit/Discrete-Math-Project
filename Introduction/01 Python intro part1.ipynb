    "Given the large number of programming languages (C/C++, Perl, Fortran, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Swift, PHP and many others), why did we choose Python? While we are big fans of the language and our answers may be somewhat biased, the following ideas are generally accepted within the Python community.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Python has an intuitive [syntax](https://github.com/sinkovit/Discrete-Math-Project/blob/master/Glossary.md#Syntax) that is easy to learn. As many programmers like to say, Python was designed to be readable by humans. This is apparent in many choices made by the creators of Python such as [delimiting](https://github.com/sinkovit/Discrete-Math-Project/blob/master/Glossary.md#Delimit) basic blocks using [whitespace](https://github.com/sinkovit/Discrete-Math-Project/blob/master/Glossary.md#Whitespace) and using simple keywords such as `and`, `or` and `not` rather than the more cryptic `&&`, `||` and `!` for constructing compound logical statements (don’t worry, we’ll define these concepts later).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Python is used in the *real world*. Python programmers are widely sought after and students who understand Python have a marketable job skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Python is an interpreted language. Simply put, this means that the code can be executed one statement or basic block at a time rather than having to first compile the entire program into an executable. Note that there are ways to compile Python code, but we don't need to get into them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The Python developer community has created a large collection of modules and packages for tasks spanning everything from numerical computing to machine learning. There’s a very good chance that someone has already written code to tackle your problem.\n"
