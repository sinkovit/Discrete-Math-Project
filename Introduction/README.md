# Introduction

## 01 Python intro part1.ipynb

The basics of Python - math operations, variables, Booleans and logic,
comments, a very quick introduction to NumPy, strings, lists and
sets. It also introduces the Jupter Notebook environment that we'll be
using throughout these lessons.

## 02 Python intro part2.ipynb

Picks up where we left off earlier and covers decision making, loops,
functions, modules and Python's help facility.

## 03 Markdown.ipynb

Jupyter Notebooks contain a mixture of executable code and markdown
cells. We've been using markdown all along, but without going into any
details. This Notebook covers markdown in more depth and describes
headers, italic and bold text, code syntax and escaping. This Notebook
and the one on markdown math formatting are not specific to Python and
make a nice break after the programming topics.

## 04 Markdown math formatting.ipynb

Extends the markdown syntax by showing how to incorporate math
formatting, such as subscripts and superscripts, square roots, math
symbols, integrals, sums, Greek letters and matrices.

## 05 Combinations and permutations.ipynb

Introduction to combinations and permutations using the Python itertools module
